This is educational project based on the official StyleGan paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04948). It implements modern machine learning methods used to generate photos of new, unseen human faces.  It uses technologies like:
- Python
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- Django with REST framework
- Google colab
    
It implements all the necessary components of neural network using combination of Keras and Tensorflow interface. Training process was done using google colab platform with google drive to store saved model weights and other training information. Moreover project implements few metrics measuring GAN quality, like Frechett Inception Distance and Iception score and small django website interface to manually generate additional pictures. Examplary output of Stylemix operation for 128x128 resolution:
